###Tips for Booking Affordable Overwater Bungalows in Bora Bora

The high season in Bora Bora runs from May to October, with peak prices in July and August. For the best deals, consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or October-November) when the weather is still favorable but prices are lower.
####2. Book in Advance
Overwater bungalows, especially the more affordable options, tend to book up quickly. Planning and booking your trip 6-12 months in advance can help you secure better rates.
####3. Look for Package Deals
Many resorts offer package deals that include meals, activities, and sometimes even airfare. These can provide significant savings compared to booking everything separately.

Consider spending part of your trip in an overwater bungalow and part in a beach or garden room. This allows you to experience the luxury of overwater living without the full cost of an extended stay.
####6. Take Advantage of Resort Credits
Some resorts offer credits for booking directly or for longer stays. These credits can be used for dining, spa treatments, or activities, helping to offset the overall cost of your trip.
####7. Be Flexible with Your Dates
If your travel dates are flexible, use tools like Google Flights or Skyscanner to find the cheapest times to fly to Bora Bora. The cost of airfare can significantly impact your overall budget.

####3. Watch the Sunset
The sunsets in Bora Bora are legendary. Enjoy this daily spectacle from the privacy of your bungalow's deck – it's a free show that never gets old.
